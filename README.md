# VisionClean 🚗💨

**VisionClean** is a computer vision project that enhances road safety by improving visibility in video footage using real-time **smoke detection and removal** techniques. The system combines **YOLO-based object detection** with **FFT-based desmoking** to support safe driving in low-visibility conditions like smog, fires, or industrial emissions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Smoke removal using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**
- ✅ Real-time object detection using **YOLOv8**
- ✅ Supports both live feed and recorded videos
- ✅ Enhances visual clarity for traffic monitoring
- ✅ Lightweight and efficient for edge deployment

---

## 🧩 Core Technologies

- **Python 3.8+**
- **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once – real-time object detection)
- **OpenCV** (video processing and image manipulation)
- **NumPy** (FFT and matrix operations)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional visualization)
- **PyTorch** (for running YOLOv8)

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Smoke on roads—caused by pollution, exhaust, fire, or industrial activity—reduces visibility and increases accident risk. Existing systems often overlook visibility enhancement. **VisionClean** addresses this by:
- Cleaning video frames using **frequency-domain filtering (FFT)**
- Detecting road objects in real time using **YOLOv8**

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Input video** (live stream or uploaded file)
2. **Smoke Identification & Desmoking** using **FFT**
3. **Object Detection** using **YOLOv8**
4. **Output**: Enhanced video with clearer visuals

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Real-time monitoring in fire-prone zones
- Smart city traffic systems
- Autonomous vehicle assistance
- Surveillance in industrial areas
